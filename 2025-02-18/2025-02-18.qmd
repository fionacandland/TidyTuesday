## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
agencies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv')

```

```{r}
agencies_n<-agencies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(nibrs_start_date),
         !is.na(agency_type)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  count(agency_type) %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("California", "Oregon", "Washington"))



```

```{r}
ggplot(agencies_n, aes(x = n, fill = agency_type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30) +
  facet_wrap(~ state) +
  labs(x = "number of agencies", title = "Law Enforcement Agencies in The West Coast", fill = "Agency Type", y = "") +
  theme_classic()
```
